# Ripple

A lightweight Windows music visualizer that reacts to Spotify desktop audio, blending fractal
geometry with liquid-light-show and Grateful Dead visual idiom.

Full spec: **`ripple-viz-build-plan.md`** (read it before writing code).

## Start here

### Step 1 — Verify the environment (5 minutes)

```powershell
dotnet --list-sdks        # need a 10.x SDK
git --version
```

If no 10.x SDK: install the **.NET 10 SDK** from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
(.NET 8 and 9 both reach end of support on 2026-11-10 — do not target them.)

GPU needs OpenGL 4.3, which is anything made in roughly the last decade. No Visual Studio
required; the `dotnet` CLI is sufficient. Silk.NET ships its native binaries via NuGet.

### Step 2 — Initialize the repo

```powershell
cd C:\dev\ripple          # or wherever
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Scaffold: frozen contracts, era presets, song modes"
```

### Step 3 — Kick off Phase 0 in Claude Design (do this first, it's the long lead)

Phase 0 decides the *look*, needs no local setup, and produces the shaders and presets that
Phase 1 consumes. Start it now and do the rest in parallel. Use the handoff prompt in §17 of the
build plan, plus the shader-extraction requirement in `CONTRACTS.md`.

### Step 4 — Point Claude Code at this repo

```powershell
claude
```

Then: *"Read ripple-viz-build-plan.md and CONTRACTS.md, then start Phase 1."*

Phase 1 builds the native shell against a synthetic feature driver — **no audio and no Phase 0
output required**. It can proceed in parallel with the harness work and gets you a running
window today.

## What is already frozen

These four things exist so that Claude Design and Claude Code build against identical
definitions. Drift between them is the main architectural risk in this project. See
`CONTRACTS.md`.

| File | What it fixes |
|---|---|
| `shaders/common/features.glsl` | The Feature Frame UBO. 14 vec4 = 224 bytes (incl. 1 reserved). Shared verbatim by both hosts. |
| `presets/eras/*.json` | 8 era presets (7 Dead eras + audio-only fallback), palettes and motion character. |
| `data/songs.json` | 19 song-mode overrides, merged over the era preset. |
| `data/venues.json` | Date and release-series lookups for the now-playing caption. |

All four hot-reload from disk at runtime. Tune them without rebuilding.

## Phase status

- [x] **0** — WebGL2 harness, 5 presets authored, shaders extracted, timeline recorder working
- [ ] **1** — Native shell renders Phase 0 presets, cross-host frame parity passes
- [ ] **2** — WASAPI loopback + full DSP, real audio drives visuals
- [ ] **3** — SMTC metadata, era mapping, song modes, now-playing caption
- [ ] **4** — Governor, idle states, safety limiter, budget test green
- [ ] **5** — Tray, hotkeys, config, packaging, full preset library

Do not proceed past a failed gate. Gate 1 (cross-host parity) validates the entire
shared-shader architecture; if it fails, fix the contract rather than forking the shaders.

## Resolved package versions

Fill this in after the first `dotnet restore` — the csproj uses `*` deliberately so the
first resolve picks current versions rather than stale ones from a spec.

| Package | Resolved version |
|---|---|
| Silk.NET.Windowing | |
| Silk.NET.OpenGL | |
| Silk.NET.Input | |
| NAudio | |

## Sanctioned shader divergences

Per `CONTRACTS.md` §2, divergences are guarded, never forked. Current count: **1**.

| Location | Guard | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `shaders/common/features.glsl` | `#ifdef RIPPLE_WEBGL` | GLSL ES 3.00 rejects `layout(binding=N)` on a uniform block (it lands in ES 3.10 / GL 4.2). The harness declares the block without it and calls `glUniformBlockBinding(prog, idx, 0)` at link time — bit-identical in effect. |

Keep this table current. A growing count means the contract is drifting.

## Known follow-up: deterministic replay

`tlTick()` in the harness interpolates between timeline frames using wall-clock `dt`. That is
correct for visual playback but wrong for an automated parity diff — the native host would have to
interpolate identically, and any frame-rate difference changes the result. The export note already
specifies the right behavior ("replay one row per frame, upload verbatim"); the implementation just
needs a deterministic step mode. **Fix this as the first task of Phase 1** — it is the thing that
makes Phase 1's own gate executable. See the Phase 1 prompt.

## Non-negotiables

Carried from the build plan. These are gates, not aspirations.

1. **Zero heap allocation in the render loop.** Enforced by a zero-Gen0-collection assertion in
   the Phase 4 budget test. This is what catches an accidental LINQ expression in a hot path.
2. **The safety limiter applies unconditionally** and is not preset-overridable below its floor.
   This runs where anyone can walk past it. See build plan §12.
3. **Three-tier metadata degradation.** Song mode → era → audio-only, each independently good.
   The app must run fully with no metadata at all — metadata failure never takes down rendering.
4. **No Spotify Web API dependency.** See build plan §2. Metadata comes from Windows SMTC.
